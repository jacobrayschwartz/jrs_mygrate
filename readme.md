# Mygrate
## Author: Jacob Schwartz

This is a simple tool developed in my free time in order to learn the basics of node and mysql integration. Note, it is not based on the project mygrate by dmfay, I'm just a little unoriginal when it comes to naming.


This is meant to be both a CLI tool and an importable module for node projects.
